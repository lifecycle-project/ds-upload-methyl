Description: We use the [methylclock](https://github.com/isglobal-brge/methylclock) package to generate the tabular methylation clocks. Which allows us to upload it to the DataSHIELD backends. 
             You can start with uploading the data. The raw data is processed by the `ds-upload` package and the autmatically uploaded to the DataSHIELD backend.
